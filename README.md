Text Mining is a way of collecting data through analysing a heap of text and deriving high quality and relevant information.<br>
Social Media continues to be a hot spot for text mining as very many people share lots of information from day to day.There is alot going on from social media campaigns to promos and all.<br>
In the light of recent events, a twitter campaign dubbed #EndSARS caught my eye as tweets flowed on the time line sharing a common sentiment about SARS.<br>
This Repository contains code that does the following:<br>
<ul><li>Mines Tweets with the hashtag EndSARS
  <li>Cleans the tweets
